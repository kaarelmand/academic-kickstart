  abstract = {Modern phosphogenesis in upwelling shelf areas is thought to be strongly influenced by microbial processes. Sulphur bacteria inhabiting modern shelfs act as bacterial “pumps” leading to the increased concentration of phosphate in sediment pore water [1] and the precipitation of the Caphosphate mineral apatite. Apatite precipitation is significantly enhanced in certain environmental conditions, e.g. in the presence of suitable nucleation substrates, such as organic matrices and bacterial ultrastructures [2]. Microstructures of phosphatic grains from modern Namibian shelf sediments were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The grains are mainly composed of massive Ca-phosphate containing some microscale pores in which conspicuous apatitic cylindrical particles were revealed along with framboidal pyrite aggregates. Such particles co-occur with biofilm and measure around 1 μm in length and 0.3 μm in diameter. They possess consistent shapes and sizes and are composed of small nanocrystallites aligned along the long axis. Superficially, they strongly resemble mineralized microbial cells. However, some morphological characteristics are not typical of microbes – many of the particles intersect, usually at angles close to 60 and 45 degrees, which may be the result of recrystallization. However, it is important to note that similar aggregates have been previously described from authigenic calcite and phosphorites [3] as well as in phosphate aggregates produced in laboratory experiments [4] forming at relatively high supersaturation levels. Our findings indicate that precaution must be taken while assessing the microbial origin of authigenic precipitates. Nevertheless, the common association of apatitic particles with organic matrices is consistent with the influence of biological processes on phosphate availability and precipitation.},

  abstract = {Microbial processes are thought to play an important role in modern marine phosphogenesis. Sulphur bacteria inhabiting modern shelfs act as bacterial “pumps” leading to the phosphate concentrations needed for precipitation of Ca-phosphate minerals such as apatite (Schulz, 2005). Apatite precipitation is highly enhanced in the presence of suitable nucleation templates, such as organic matrices and bacterial ultrastructures. The microstructure of phosphatic grains from modern Namibian shelf sediments was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The grains are composed of mostly pure Ca-phosphate and are highly porous. The pore walls are largely coated with rod-shaped microstructures of around 1μm in length and 0.3μm in diameter which co-occur with an organic matrix. The rods possess consistent shapes and sizes, and are composed of nanocrystallites arranged along the long axis. Superficially, they strongly resemble mineralized microbial cells. However, some morphological features are not consistent with microbial origin. Many of the rods intersect at angles close to 60 or 90 degrees. Together with other microstructures present in the grains, they seem to form a continuum from rods through dumbbells to semispherical. Remarkably similar aggregates, called biomimetic fluoroapatite-gelatine composites, have been described from laboratory experiments at high supersaturation (e.g.Busch 1999). Our findings indicate that precaution must be taken while assessing the microbial origin of authigenic precipitates. Nevertheless, the common association of biomimetic apatite composites with organic matrices is consistent with the influence ofbiological processes on phosphate availability and precipitation.},

  abstract = {The trace metal Molybdenum (Mo) has seen widespread use in estimating ocean redox conditions throughout the rock record, due to its bimodal behaviour in euxinic versus non-euxinic waters. The size of the marine Mo pool is determined by the extent of sea bottom euxinia and the rate of terrestrial oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals (Robbins et al. 2016). Large-scale studies of the rock record have found an uptick in the Mo concentrations of black shales up to 80 ppm in the Paleoproterozoic, which has been attributed to an increase in oxidative weathering and oxic marine conditions following the rapid rise of oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (C. Scott et al. 2008). While the basic principles of Mo cycling are relatively well-understood, the specific mechanisms controlling the removal of Mo into sediments are a subject of much debate, mainly involving the roles of iron oxides and organic matter in providing adsorption sites for Mo. Furthermore, it is not known whether organic matter acts as a shuttle of Mo from the water column to the sediments or whether Mo is preferentially removed below the sediment-water interface (Dahl et al. 2016). Here are presented data on the upper section of the NW Russian Zaonega Fm organic-rich shales, which contain unprecedented Mo concentrations (up to 2000 ppm) for this age. Whole-rock and in-situ measurements of δ 98 Mo and [Mo] coupled with detailed lithological and geochemical controls allow for a thorough evaluation of the mechanisms controlling the redox-sensitive trace metal budget in Precambrian black shales. The contributions of different Mo transport mechanisms, the role of hydrothermal input, the recrystallization of sulfide species and the input of methanotrophic organic matter are considered, with important implications for global paleoredox models based off of the trace metal systematics of black shales.},

  abstract = {The Paleoproterozoic era is characterized by fundamental shifts in the redox conditions of Earth’s surface environments. Following the rise of atmospheric O2 at  2.4 Ga, the  2.3–2.0 Ga Lomagundi positive carbon isotope excursion (LIE) has been suggested to reflect atmospheric O2 approaching modern levels [1]. It has been inferred that the waning stage of the LIE was accompanied by a substantial decline in atmospheric O2. The sparse Paleoproterozoic rock record, however, complicates the interpretation of paleoredox proxies. Redox-sensitive elements (RSE; Mo, V, Re, U, and Cr) are frequently used to infer atmospheric and water column redox conditions. Typically, RSE are concentrated in oxygenated waters and sequestered into anoxic sediments, with their abundances in sedimentary successions governed by the global extent of anoxic sinks at deposition. Compilations of sedimentary rock records have demonstrated variations in RSE abundance with low concentrations in the Archean, increasing in the Paleoproterozoic before declining in the Mesoproterozoic [e.g., 2]. The  2.0 Ga Zaonega Formation (ZF) in NW-Russia is a well-preserved volcano-sedimentary succession composed of interlayered organic-rich (10-70 wt.\%) mudstones, carbonates and magmatic rocks deposited shortly after the termination of the LIE. These organic-rich rocks are key for understanding the architecture of late Paleoproterozoic redox conditions. Here we report RSE enrichment and isotope data from recent upper ZF drill cores. RSE concentrations are among the highest reported for the Precambrian (Mo ¿ 2000 ppm, V ¿ 8000 ppm, Re ¿ 1.5 ppm), implying oxidative continental weathering, a limited extent for seafloor anoxia, and potentially elevated seawater sulphate compared what was previously suggested at  2 Ga [2]. Our results suggest a significant time-gap between the LIE termination and onset of Mesoproterozoic low-O2 conditions.},

  abstract = {The Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE;  2.22–2.06 Ga), the longest-lived C isotope excursion in Earth’s history, is commonly viewed as associated with increased burial of organic matter that lead to a Paleoproterozoic “Oxygen overshoot” (Bekker \& Holland, 2012). The end of the LJE is, conversely, associated with a recovery of anoxic conditions that might have arrested the evolution of complex life for the next billion years. The post-LJE Zaonega Fm. (ZF;  2.0 Ga), an organic matter-rich carbonate-mudstone succession, is a linchpin in the study of Paloeproterozoic redox shifts. Geochemical data from the ZF has often been interpreted as prime evidence for an “O2 crash” (e.g., Scott et al., 2014), despite other authors including the ZF among well-oxygenated LJE-type successions (e.g., Partin et al., 2013). Here, we present trace element analyses from several recent drill cores in the ZF that contain some of the highest Mo, U and Re concentrations reported to date in pre-Neoproterozoic shales (1009 μg g−1; 238 μg g−1; and 516 ng g−1, respectively). These enrichments are most parsimoniously explained through the establishment of an efficient trace metal trap in a highly bio-productive semi-restricted basin that was intermittently, but reliably, connected to a trace metal-rich ocean. Given that U and Re can only accumulate in an oxic water column, these data imply oxic waters overlying continental shelves during the deposition of the ZF and, therefore, undiminished levels of O2 following the LJE. The temporal decoupling between the LJE and the O2 overshoot, in turn, places doubt on our understanding of the mechanisms underlying some of the most profound environmental shifts in the Paleoproterozoic.},
