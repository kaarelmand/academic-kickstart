Kaarel Mänd is an Earth science PhD candidate at University of Alberta under the supervision of [Dr. Kurt O. Konhauser](https://www.konhauser.com/), [Dr. Aivo Lepland](https://cage.uit.no/employee/aivo-lepland/), and [Dr. Kalle Kirsimäe](https://www.etis.ee/Portal/Persons/Display/15b123a0-41f4-48ff-b6c6-b06f928020a4?lang=ENG). He focuses on changes in rock weathering and nutrient cycling that affected Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and biosphere in the Precambrian eons. For this purpose, he utilizes a variety of trace metal-based paleoenvironmental proxies preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks.
