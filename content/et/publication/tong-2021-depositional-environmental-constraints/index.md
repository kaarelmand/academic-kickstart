abstract: 'The late Neoarchean, ~ 2.53 to 2.51 Ga Dagushan banded iron formation (BIF),
  is a typical Algoma-type BIF located in the northeast part of the North China craton.
  Despite having undergone upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphism,
  the Dagushan BIF retains evidence of varied depositional facies, making it an ideal
  archive to evaluate the paleomarine environment and the paragenesis of the ore minerals.
  A transition from oxide to silicate to carbonate facies BIF is evident in a northward
  direction. The mineralogical composition shifts from magnetite and quartz in the
  south through a magnetite-quartz-cummingtonite/stilpnomelane assemblage in the transition
  zone to magnetite-siderite in the north. Such a distinct distribution of mineralogical
  facies correlates well with the depositional environment of the BIF. The carbonate
  facies BIFs formed in a near-shore, proximal environment, whereas the oxide and
  silicate facies BIF assemblages formed in deeper waters, distal to the paleoshoreline.
  The BIF samples display characteristic seawater-like rare earth element + yttrium
  (REE + Y) profiles with positive La and Y anomalies and heavy REE enrichment relative
  to the light REEs when normalized to post-Archean Australian shale. Positive Eu
  anomalies suggest a high-temperature hydrothermal contribution to the BIF. The absence
  of a negative Ce anomaly in nearly all samples, coupled with positive δ56Fe in magnetite
  in all mineralogical facies, indicates a dominantly anoxic water column contemporaneous
  with deposition of the BIF. At ~ 2.53 Ga in the Anshan area, seawater was mostly
  anoxic and rich in ferrous iron. Dissolved ferrous iron in upwelling hydrothermal
  fluids was oxidized and precipitated as Fe(III) oxyhydroxides in the photic zone
  leading to BIF formation. Proximal to hydrothermal vents, magnetite formed via the
  reaction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and aqueous Fe(II) supplied from the hydrothermal
  fluids and microbial dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) coupled to organic carbon
  oxidation. Proximal to a paleoshoreline, siderite formed through DIR, as evidenced
  by the depleted δ13C values and the presence of graphite. Silicates, such as stilpnomelane
  and cummingtonite, are considered to be the metamorphic products of early diagenetic
  silicates (e.g.,~nontronite) that formed in the water column from admixtures of
  Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and amorphous silica.'
