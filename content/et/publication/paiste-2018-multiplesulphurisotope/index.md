abstract: 'The exceptionally organic-rich rocks of the 1.98 Ga Zaonega Formation deposited
  in the Onega Basin, NW Russia, have refined our understanding of Earth System evolution
  during the Paleoproterozoic rise in atmospheric oxygen. These rocks were formed
  in vent- or seep-influenced settings contemporaneous with voluminous mafic volcanism
  and contain strongly 13C-depleted organic matter. Here we report new isotopic (δ34S,
  Δ33S, Δ36S, δ13Corg) and mineralogical, major element, total sulphur and organic
  carbon data for the upper part of the Zaonega Formation, which was deposited shortly
  after the termination of the Lomagundi-Jatuli positive carbon isotope excursion.
  The data were collected on a recently obtained 102 m drill-core section and show
  a δ13Corg shift from −38‰ to −25‰. Sedimentary sulphides have δ34S values typically
  between +15‰ and +25‰ reflecting closed-system sulphur isotope behaviour driven
  by high rates of microbial sulphate reduction, high sulphate demand, hydrothermal
  activity and hydrocarbon seepage. Four intervals record δ34S values that exceed
  +30‰. We interpret these unusually 34S-enriched sulphides to be a result of limited
  sulphate diffusion into pore waters due to changes in sedimentation and/or periods
  of basinal restriction. Additionally, there are four negative δ34S excursions that
  are interpreted to reflect changes in the open/closed-system behaviour of sulphate
  reduction or availability of reactive iron. Our findings highlight the influence
  of basinal processes in regulating sulphur isotope records and the need for care
  before interpreting such signals as reflecting global conditions.'
