abstract: 'Paleoproterozoic sedimentary successions are important archives of the redox
  evolution of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. Efforts to unravel the dynamics of our
  planet’s early oxygenation from this archive rely on various geochemical proxies,
  including stable carbon and sulfur isotopes. However, ancient metasedimentary rocks
  often experienced early- and late-stage (bio)geochemical processes making it difficult
  to discern primary environmental signals from bulk-rock δ13Corg and δ34S values.
  Such complexity in carbon and sulfur isotope systematics contributes to uncertainty
  about the redox structure of Paleoproterozoic oceans. A currently popular idea is
  that, following the Great Oxidation Event, global changes led to low-oxygen environments
  and temporally fluctuating ocean redox conditions that lasted until the Neoproterozoic.
  The volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Onega Basin have figured prominently in this
  concept, particularly the exceptionally organic-rich rocks of the 1.98 Ga Zaonega
  Formation. However, a growing body of evidence shows that local depositional processes
  acted to form the δ13Corg and pyrite δ34S records of the Zaonega Formation, thus
  calling for careful assessment of the global significance of these isotope records.
  Placing new and existing organic carbon and sulfur isotope data from the Zaonega
  Formation into the context of basin history and by comparing those results with
  key Paleoproterozoic successions of the Francevillian Basin (Gabon), the Pechenga
  Greenstone Belt (NW Russia) and the Animikie Basin (Canada), we show that the stratigraphic
  δ13Corg and pyrite δ34S trends can be explained by local perturbations in biogeochemical
  carbon and sulfur cycling without requiring global drivers. Despite their temporal
  disparity, we also demonstrate that individual successions share certain geological
  traits (e.g. magmatic and/or tectonic activity, hydrocarbon generation, basin restriction)
  suggesting that their pyrite δ34S and δ13Corg trends were governed by common underlying
  mechanisms (e.g. similar basinal evolution and biogeochemical feedbacks) and are
  not necessarily unique to certain time intervals. We further show that pyrites in
  these successions that are most likely to capture ambient seawater sulfate isotopic
  composition have consistent δ34S values of 15–18‰, which hints at remarkable stability
  in the marine sulfur cycle over most of the Paleoproterozoic Era.'
