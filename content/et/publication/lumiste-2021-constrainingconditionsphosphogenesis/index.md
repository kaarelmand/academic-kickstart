abstract: "Modern phosphogenesis occurs on continental margins influenced by upwelling
  and high primary productivity. The formation of phosphatic sediments is coupled
  to global climate fluctuations, biological cycling of phosphorus and local redox
  conditions. Although the processes involved in phosphogenesis are well described,
  high-resolution data on the redox and stable isotope systematics in Recent in-situ
  phosphorites are scarce. In this contribution, we investigate the trace element
  and sulfur, nitrogen and organic carbon stable isotope composition of Recent in-situ
  phosphatic sediments off the coast of Namibia. Also, we examine the reliability
  of different widely used geochemical proxies in phosphatic sediments. Our results
  suggest a shift from sulfidic to suboxic conditions, coinciding with the maximum
  in solid calcium phosphate mineral concentration. This shift is accompanied by unidirectional
  changes in Mo and Re enrichments and TOC abundance. Relatively low pyrite δ34S values
  (ca -20‰) of phosphatic sediments indicate open system fractionation during phosphogenesis.
  The initiation of phosphogenesis is also accompanied by negative shifts in sedimentary
  δ13Corg and δ15N values. Phosphate associated sulfate (PAS) δ34S values are lower
  than modern seawater sulfate values, suggesting the involvement of chemolithotrophic
  sulfur oxidation. Our results show a shift in redox conditions from sulfidic to
  (sub)oxic, coupled with active sulfur cycling are prerequisites for phosphogenesis.
  Phosphatic sediments show substantial enrichments in U and V highlighting the complexity
  of using these elements, as well as V/(V+Ni) and V/Cr, as redox proxies particularly
  in phosphorites and phosphatic sediments."
