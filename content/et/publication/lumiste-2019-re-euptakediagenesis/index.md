  caption: 'Backscattered scanning electron microscope images of pelletal apatitic grains from core CG4 and LA-ICP-MS elemental distribution with enrichment of REE+Y in the outer rim of the grains. Scale bars are in mg/kg and show different values for each individual element. The grain on the right shows concentric layering and several zones of apatite growth. The surface of the internal zone shows enrichment in REE+Y, U and Th similar to the enrichment zone of the external layers of the whole grain.'

abstract: 'Rare Earth Elements and Yttrium (REE+Y) distribution in authigenic phases
  are frequently used as proxies for reconstructing past seawater conditions. Sedimentary
  apatite precipitates near the sediment-water interface and is therefore capable
  of recording the REE+Y composition of the overlying water column. While the overprinting
  of primary REE+Y signal during late stage diagenesis is a widely known phenomenon,
  less is known about early diagenetic effects. In this study, we investigate the
  REE+Y distribution in Recent sedimentary apatites found on the Namibian shelf using
  in situ mapping by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).
  The Namibian phosphorite deposits consist of reworked and redeposited pelletal apatitic
  grains, ranging from Miocene to Pleistocene in age, and pristine concretionary apatitic
  grains that formed during Pleistocene to Recent. The results of this study show
  that the REE+Y signatures of pelletal and concretionary apatitic grains are different
  with both types showing intragranular variability and differences between grain
  centers and rims. The REE+Y are concentrated in the external part of the apatitic
  grains, forming a 10–20 μm wide “enrichment zone”. While the central parts of apatitic
  grains are low in REE+Y (∑REE+Y $<$ 450 mg/kg), the external layers can reach ∑REE+Y
  concentrations as high as 4100 mg/kg. REE+Y patterns from the center of Recent concretionary
  apatitic grains are similar to the REE+Y distribution of modern seawater. Enriched
  rims of Recent concretionary apatitic grains as well as pelletal grains have lost
  the characteristic modern seawater features: negative Ce-anomaly and high Y/Ho ratio.
  The REE+Y patterns of these enrichment zones indicate REE+Y scavenging from suboxic-sulfidic
  pore water after burial or during precipitation at the fluctuating redoxcline. It
  is evident that REE+Y patterns in bulk digests of authigenic apatite cannot be relied
  on to record paleoseawater characteristics. Micro-scale REE+Y analyses of apatitic
  grains can, however, reveal aspects of their diagenetic histories.'
