abstract: 'Banded iron formations (BIFs) are enigmatic chemical sedimentary rocks that
  chronicle the geochemical and microbial cycling of iron and carbon in the Precambrian.
  However, the formation pathways of Fe carbonate, namely siderite, remain disputed.
  Here, we provide photomicrographs, Fe, C and O isotope of siderite, and organic
  C isotope of the whole rock from the ~ 2.52 Ga Dagushan BIF in the Anshan area,
  China, to discuss the origin of siderite. There are small magnetite grains that
  occur as inclusions within siderite, suggesting a diagenetic origin of the siderite.
  Moreover, the siderites have a wide range of iron isotope compositions (&delta;56FeSd)
  from &minus;0.180&permil; to +0.463&permil;, and a relatively negative C isotope
  composition (&delta;13CSd = &minus;6.20&permil; to &minus;1.57&permil;). These results
  are compatible with the reduction of an Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide precursor to dissolved
  Fe(II) through microbial dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) during early diagenesis.
  Partial reduction of the precursor and possible mixing with seawater Fe(II) could
  explain the presence of siderite with negative &delta;56Fe, while sustained reaction
  of residual Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide could have produced siderite with positive &delta;56Fe
  values. Bicarbonate derived from both DIR and seawater may have provided a C source
  for siderite formation. Our results suggest that microbial respiration played an
  important role in the formation of siderite in the late Archean Dagushan BIF.'
