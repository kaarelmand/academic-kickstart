abstract: "The ~2.22–2.06 Ga Lomagundi Event was the longest positive carbon isotope
  excursion in Earth’s history and is commonly interpreted to reflect perturbations
  in continental weathering and the phosphorous cycle. Previous models have focused
  on mechanisms of increasing phosphorous solubilization during weathering without
  focusing on transport to the oceans and its dispersion in seawater. Building from
  new experimental results, here we report kaolinite readily absorbs phosphorous under
  acidic freshwater conditions, but quantitatively releases phosphorous under seawater
  conditions where it becomes bioavailable to phytoplankton. The strong likelihood
  of high weathering intensities and associated high kaolinite content in post-Great-Oxidation-Event
  paleosols suggests there would have been enhanced phosphorus shuttling from the
  continents into marine environments. A kaolinite phosphorous shuttle introduces
  the potential for nonlinearity in the fluxes of phosphorous to the oceans with increases
  in chemical weathering intensity."
