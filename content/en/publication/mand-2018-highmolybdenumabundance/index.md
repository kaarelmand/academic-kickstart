abstract: 'The Paleoproterozoic era is characterized by fundamental shifts in the redox
  conditions of Earth’s surface environments. Following the rise of atmospheric O2
  at  2.4 Ga, the  2.3–2.0 Ga Lomagundi positive carbon isotope excursion (LIE) has
  been suggested to reflect atmospheric O2 approaching modern levels [1]. It has been
  inferred that the waning stage of the LIE was accompanied by a substantial decline
  in atmospheric O2. The sparse Paleoproterozoic rock record, however, complicates
  the interpretation of paleoredox proxies. Redox-sensitive elements (RSE; Mo, V,
  Re, U, and Cr) are frequently used to infer atmospheric and water column redox conditions.
  Typically, RSE are concentrated in oxygenated waters and sequestered into anoxic
  sediments, with their abundances in sedimentary successions governed by the global
  extent of anoxic sinks at deposition. Compilations of sedimentary rock records have
  demonstrated variations in RSE abundance with low concentrations in the Archean,
  increasing in the Paleoproterozoic before declining in the Mesoproterozoic [e.g.,
  2]. The  2.0 Ga Zaonega Formation (ZF) in NW-Russia is a well-preserved volcano-sedimentary
  succession composed of interlayered organic-rich (10-70 wt.%) mudstones, carbonates
  and magmatic rocks deposited shortly after the termination of the LIE. These organic-rich
  rocks are key for understanding the architecture of late Paleoproterozoic redox
  conditions. Here we report RSE enrichment and isotope data from recent upper ZF
  drill cores. RSE concentrations are among the highest reported for the Precambrian
  (Mo ¿ 2000 ppm, V ¿ 8000 ppm, Re ¿ 1.5 ppm), implying oxidative continental weathering,
  a limited extent for seafloor anoxia, and potentially elevated seawater sulphate
  compared what was previously suggested at  2 Ga [2]. Our results suggest a significant
  time-gap between the LIE termination and onset of Mesoproterozoic low-O2 conditions.'
