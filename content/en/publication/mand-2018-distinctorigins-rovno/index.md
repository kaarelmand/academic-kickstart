abstract: 'Ambers—fossilized plant resins—are a rich and unique source of paleoecological
  data due to their ability to preserve soft body fossils. However, interpretations
  concerning their environmental context are often hampered by uncertainties in the
  relationship between assemblages of inclusions and geological context, particularly
  in the case of secondarily redeposited ambers such as those from the Paleogene of
  Central Europe. Here we use stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analyses, as well
  as FTIR spectroscopy, from the northwestern Ukrainian Rovno amber deposit, to provide
  independent constraints on the geographic and temporal origins of Rovno amber. These
  analyses address the relationship between the Rovno and Baltic amber deposits as
  well as German Bitterfeld amber—a subject of considerable debate regarding their
  provenance. Rovno amber has a δ13C signature of −23.3 ± 0.9‰, similar to both Baltic
  and Bitterfeld ambers. Since there is a secular decreasing δ13C trend among amber
  deposits since the Early Eocene, a roughly contemporaneous origin of these deposits
  in the Eocene can be deduced. However, Rovno amber displays a δ2H signature of −258
  ± 9‰, 19‰ more positive than Baltic amber, and directly comparable to Bitterfeld
  amber. This difference relates to precipitation sources and mean annual temperatures
  of the amber source regions, and suggests a much more southerly origin of Rovno
  amber relative to Baltic amber. FTIR spectra of each of these ambers are nearly
  identical and suggest that resin-producing trees were from similar families, despite
  contrasting source regions. Thus, we provide the first clear geochemical evidence
  for the distinct origin of Rovno and Baltic amber deposits, with implications for
  paleoecological studies involving inclusions from these deposits, and for determining
  the provenance of archaeological amber finds.'
