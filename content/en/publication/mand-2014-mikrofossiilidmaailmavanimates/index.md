  caption: 'Scanning electron back-scatted micrograph of shungite rocks with a high phosphorous content. The image shows a typical phosphatic nodule, consisting of apatitic cylinders. The deflecting laminae surrounding the nodule suggest that the nodule pre-dated sediment lithification. Brighter areas reflect higher apatite content, darker areas reflect organic carbon content.'
