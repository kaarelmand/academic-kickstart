abstract: 'The c. 2.0 Ga Zaonega Formation of the Onega Basin (NW Russia) has been
  central in efforts to understand what led to the initial rise (Great Oxidation Event,
  GOE) and postulated fall in free atmospheric oxygen and associated high-amplitude
  carbon cycle excursions, the Lomagundi-Jatuli Event (LJE) and subsequent Shunga
  Event during Paleoproterozoic time. The Formation accumulated shortly after the
  LJE and encompasses both the recovery in the carbon cycle and hypothesised contraction
  of the oceanic oxidant pool. However, interpreting the correct environmental context
  recorded by geochemical signatures in the Zaonega rocks is difficult due to a complex
  depositional and diagenetic history. In order to robustly constrain that history,
  we undertook a multiproxy study (mineralogy, petrography, carbon isotope and rare
  earth element composition) of carbonate beds in the upper part of the Zaonega Formation
  recovered in the 102-m composite section of the OnZap drill-cores. Our findings
  differentiate primary environmental signatures from secondary overprinting and show
  that: (i) the best-preserved carbonate beds define an upwards increasing δ13Ccarb
  trend from c. -5.4‰ to near 0‰; and that (ii) large intra-bed δ13Ccarb variations
  reflect varying contributions of methanotrophic dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
  to the basinal DIC pool. Rare earth element and yttrium (REYSN) patterns confirm
  a marine origin of the carbonate beds whereas a consistent positive EuSN anomaly
  suggests a strong high temperature hydrothermal input during accumulation of the
  Zaonega Formation. Importantly, the presence of a negative CeSN anomaly in the REYSN
  pattern indicates an oxygenated atmosphere-ocean system shortly after the LJE and
  indicates that models invoking a fall in oxygen at that time require reassessment.'
