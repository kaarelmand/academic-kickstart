abstract: 'Sedimentary phosphorites comprise a major phosphorus (P) ore, yet their
  formation remains poorly understood. Extant polyphosphate-metabolizing bacterial
  communities are known to act as bacterial phosphate-pumps, leading to episodically
  high dissolved phosphate concentrations in pore waters of organic-rich sediment.
  These conditions can promote the precipitation of amorphous precursor phases that
  are quickly converted to apatite—usually in carbonate fluorapatite form [Ca10(PO4,CO3)6F2-3].
  To assess the mechanisms underpinning the nucleation and growth of sedimentary apatite,
  we sampled P-rich sediments from the Namibian shelf, a modern environment where
  phosphogenesis presently occurs. The P-rich fraction of the topmost centimetres
  of sediment mainly consists of pellets about 50–400 μm in size, which in turn are
  comprised of micron-sized apatite particles that are often arranged into radial
  structures with diameters ranging from 2 to 4 μm, and morphologies that range from
  rod-shapes to dumbbells to spheres that resemble laboratory-grown fluorapatite–gelatin
  nanocomposites known from double-diffusion experiments in organic matrices. The
  nucleation and growth of authigenic apatite on the Namibian shelf is likely analogous
  to these laboratory-produced precipitates, where organic macromolecules play a central
  role in apatite nucleation and growth. The high density of apatite nucleation sites
  within the pellets ($>$109 particles per cm3) suggests precipitation at high pore
  water phosphate concentrations that have been reported from the Namibian shelf and
  may be attributed to microbial phosphate pumping. The intimate association of organic
  material with the apatite could suggest a possible role of biological substrata,
  such as exopolymeric substances (EPS), in the nucleation of apatite precursors.
  Importantly, we do not observe any evidence that the apatite particles are actual
  phosphatized microbes, contradicting some earlier studies. Nevertheless, these results
  further evidence the potential importance of microbially derived (extracellular)
  organic matter as a template for phosphatic mineral nucleation in both recent and
  ancient phosphorites.'
