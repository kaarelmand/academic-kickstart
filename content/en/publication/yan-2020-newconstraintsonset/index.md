abstract: "The onset of the Middle Permian Emeishan Large Igneous Province (ELIP),
  is commonly implicated in the Guadalupian mass extinction, one of the largest Phanerozoic
  extinction events, yet the contribution of the ELIP to this biotic event remains
  unresolved because of a lack of appropriate age constraints. In this study, we examined
  claystone beds overlying the cherty limestone of the Maokou Formation and underlying
  the flood basalts of the ELIP that were emplaced around the Guadalupian-Lopingian
  Boundary. Integrated petrographic, mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic features
  indicate that the studied claystones contain significant components from mafic volcanic
  ash that was likely associated with the emplacement of the ELIP. Zircons from the
  claystones yield UPb ages of ~ 262.5~Ma, which predates the subaerial eruptive phase
  of the ELIP (259.1â€“260.4~Ma), but is comparable to the J. altudaensis conodont biostratigraphic
  zone (~ 263~Ma, Middle Capitanian Stage) which is contemporaneous with the emplacement
  of early-stage Emeishan subaqueous pillow basalts and mafic volcaniclastics. Our
  data provide a crucial new constraint on the lower age limit for the onset of the
  ELIP, which was likely associated with violent submarine eruptions and thus could
  have contributed to the loss of marine fauna during the Guadalupian mass extinction."
