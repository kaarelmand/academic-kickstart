abstract: "Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that clay minerals (e.g.,
  kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite) have higher affinities for some trace elements
  under acidic versus alkaline conditions. This suggests that clays might be important
  vectors in the transport of trace elements from sites of acidic chemical weathering
  on land to marine depositional environments. To determine if clays behave similarly
  in nature, we collected water and mud (consisting 38.5-61.1% of kaolinite and montmorillonite)
  samples from boiling, low-pH, mud pools venting at the El Tatio Geyser Field (ETGF)
  in Chile. Based on elemental abundances in the aqueous/solid phases, we observed
  that mud samples collected from lower pH pools (e.g., pH=2.42, 3.55) have high concentration
  factors for anionic elements (e.g., P, As) but low concentration factors for cationic
  elements (e.g., Ca, Mn, Sr), while mud from higher pH pools (e.g., pH=4.87, 5.84)
  display the opposite trend. Acid-base leaching experiments further reveal that increasing
  solution pH (to reflect downstream transport) led to the release of As and P from
  the mud surfaces due to increasingly negative surface charge, while decreasing pH
  (to determine the effects of re-acidification) released Li, Ca, Co, Sr, Mo and Cd.
  Our study confirms previous experimental findings that demonstrate clay minerals
  can assemble a diverse inventory of trace elements during acid weathering (e.g.,
  As) but then liberate them back into the aqueous phase as aqueous pH increases.
  Importantly, these observations provide a mechanism to account for the previous
  observations of regional As contamination in rivers downstream of the ETGF. This
