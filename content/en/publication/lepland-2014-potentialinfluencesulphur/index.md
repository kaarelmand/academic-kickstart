abstract: 'All known forms of life require phosphorus, and biological processes strongly
  influence the global phosphorus cycle1. Although the record of life on Earth extends
  back to 3.8,billion years ago2 and the advent of biological phosphate processing
  can be tracked to at least 3.5,billion years ago3, the earliest known P-rich deposits
  appeared only 2,billion years ago4,5. The onset of P deposition has been attributed
  to the rise of atmospheric oxygen 2.4–2.3,billion years ago and the related profound
  biogeochemical shifts6,7,8,9, which increased the riverine input of phosphate to
  the ocean and boosted biological productivity and phosphogenesis5,10. However, the
  P-rich deposits post-date the rise of oxygen by about 300,million years. Here we
  use microfabric, trace element and carbon isotope analyses to assess the environmental
  setting and redox conditions of the 2-billion-year-old P-rich deposits of the vent-
  or seep-influenced Zaonega Formation, northwest Russia. We identify phosphatized
  microorganism fossils that resemble modern methanotrophic archaea and sulphur-oxidizing
  bacteria, analogous to organisms found in modern seep settings and upwelling zones
  with a sharp redoxcline11,12. We therefore propose that the P-rich deposits in the
  Zaonega Formation were formed by phosphogenesis mediated by sulphur bacteria, similar
  to modern sites13, and by the precipitation of calcium phosphate minerals on microbial
  templates during early diagenesis.'
