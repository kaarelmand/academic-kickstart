abstract: 'The trace metal Molybdenum (Mo) has seen widespread use in estimating ocean
  redox conditions throughout the rock record, due to its bimodal behaviour in euxinic
  versus non-euxinic waters. The size of the marine Mo pool is determined by the extent
  of sea bottom euxinia and the rate of terrestrial oxidative weathering of sulfide
  minerals (Robbins et al. 2016). Large-scale studies of the rock record have found
  an uptick in the Mo concentrations of black shales up to 80 ppm in the Paleoproterozoic,
  which has been attributed to an increase in oxidative weathering and oxic marine
  conditions following the rapid rise of oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event (C.
  Scott et al. 2008). While the basic principles of Mo cycling are relatively well-understood,
  the specific mechanisms controlling the removal of Mo into sediments are a subject
  of much debate, mainly involving the roles of iron oxides and organic matter in
  providing adsorption sites for Mo. Furthermore, it is not known whether organic
  matter acts as a shuttle of Mo from the water column to the sediments or whether
  Mo is preferentially removed below the sediment-water interface (Dahl et al. 2016).
  Here are presented data on the upper section of the NW Russian Zaonega Fm organic-rich
  shales, which contain unprecedented Mo concentrations (up to 2000 ppm) for this
  age. Whole-rock and in-situ measurements of δ 98 Mo and [Mo] coupled with detailed
  lithological and geochemical controls allow for a thorough evaluation of the mechanisms
  controlling the redox-sensitive trace metal budget in Precambrian black shales.
  The contributions of different Mo transport mechanisms, the role of hydrothermal
  input, the recrystallization of sulfide species and the input of methanotrophic
  organic matter are considered, with important implications for global paleoredox
  models based off of the trace metal systematics of black shales.'
