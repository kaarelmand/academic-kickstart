abstract: 'Modern phosphogenesis in upwelling shelf areas is thought to be strongly
  influenced by microbial processes. Sulphur bacteria inhabiting modern shelfs act
  as bacterial “pumps” leading to the increased concentration of phosphate in sediment
  pore water [1] and the precipitation of the Caphosphate mineral apatite. Apatite
  precipitation is significantly enhanced in certain environmental conditions, e.g.
  in the presence of suitable nucleation substrates, such as organic matrices and
  bacterial ultrastructures [2]. Microstructures of phosphatic grains from modern
  Namibian shelf sediments were examined using scanning electron microscopy. The grains
  are mainly composed of massive Ca-phosphate containing some microscale pores in
  which conspicuous apatitic cylindrical particles were revealed along with framboidal
  pyrite aggregates. Such particles co-occur with biofilm and measure around 1 μm
  in length and 0.3 μm in diameter. They possess consistent shapes and sizes and are
  composed of small nanocrystallites aligned along the long axis. Superficially, they
  strongly resemble mineralized microbial cells. However, some morphological characteristics
  are not typical of microbes – many of the particles intersect, usually at angles
  close to 60 and 45 degrees, which may be the result of recrystallization. However,
  it is important to note that similar aggregates have been previously described from
  authigenic calcite and phosphorites [3] as well as in phosphate aggregates produced
  in laboratory experiments [4] forming at relatively high supersaturation levels.
  Our findings indicate that precaution must be taken while assessing the microbial
  origin of authigenic precipitates. Nevertheless, the common association of apatitic
  particles with organic matrices is consistent with the influence of biological processes
  on phosphate availability and precipitation.'
