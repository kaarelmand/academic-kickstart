abstract: 'Microbial processes are thought to play an important role in modern marine
  phosphogenesis. Sulphur bacteria inhabiting modern shelfs act as bacterial “pumps”
  leading to the phosphate concentrations needed for precipitation of Ca-phosphate
  minerals such as apatite (Schulz, 2005). Apatite precipitation is highly enhanced
  in the presence of suitable nucleation templates, such as organic matrices and bacterial
  ultrastructures. The microstructure of phosphatic grains from modern Namibian shelf
  sediments was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The grains are composed
  of mostly pure Ca-phosphate and are highly porous. The pore walls are largely coated
  with rod-shaped microstructures of around 1μm in length and 0.3μm in diameter which
  co-occur with an organic matrix. The rods possess consistent shapes and sizes, and
  are composed of nanocrystallites arranged along the long axis. Superficially, they
  strongly resemble mineralized microbial cells. However, some morphological features
  are not consistent with microbial origin. Many of the rods intersect at angles close
  to 60 or 90 degrees. Together with other microstructures present in the grains,
  they seem to form a continuum from rods through dumbbells to semispherical. Remarkably
  similar aggregates, called biomimetic fluoroapatite-gelatine composites, have been
  described from laboratory experiments at high supersaturation (e.g.Busch 1999).
  Our findings indicate that precaution must be taken while assessing the microbial
  origin of authigenic precipitates. Nevertheless, the common association of biomimetic
  apatite composites with organic matrices is consistent with the influence ofbiological
  processes on phosphate availability and precipitation.'
