I am a Research Fellow in Earth sciences at the [University of Tartu](https://www.geoloogia.ut.ee/en) in Estonia. I am fascinated by changes in nutrient cycling and rock weathering that took place on the ancient Earth, drastically affecting its oceans, atmosphere, and biosphere. To study these shifts, I utilize a variety of trace metal-based paleoenvironmental proxies preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks, especially those formed in the Palaeoproterozoic and Palaeozoic eras.
