  abstract = {A spike in chromium (Cr) abundance above crustal background in iron formations post-dating the Great Oxidation Event (ca. 2.5-2.3 billion years ago) has been suggested to reflect the evolution of terrestrial aerobic pyrite and siderite oxidation and the initiation of widespread acid rock drainage that would enhance Cr transport from terrestrial weathering environments to the oceans. However, it remains unclear whether Cr was transported in a soluble form (as Cr(III) or Cr(VI)), or bound to particulate surfaces. Here, we experimentally investigate the binding mechanisms of Cr(III) – the typical oxidation state associated with primary igneous minerals such as chromite – to three common soil clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite) using extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that Cr(III) precipitates on the clay surfaces over a pH range of 6 to 8 as guyanaite (β-CrOOH) due to the replacement of surface Al-octahedra by paired Cr(III) octahedra. Bidentate bonding with a Cr-Cr interatomic distance of 3.43-3.51 Å indicates the incorporation of Cr(III) into the clay structure. A comparison between Cr(III) adsorption/precipitation onto the three clays and the desorption of Cr(III) from Cr(III)-spiked clays shows that kaolinite has the highest retention capacity for Cr(III), a predictable result given that an entire Al-octahedral sheet is exposed for Cr(III) binding, while illite and montmorillonite only have Al-edge sites. Moreover, Cr(III) was essentially immobilized in our experiments except under very acidic conditions (pH{$<$}2). Extending our results to the interpretation of the Cr record in iron formations, we suggest that under intense chemical weathering conditions, not only did acidity promote the solubilization of Cr(III) from primary Cr-bearing minerals, but that parent rocks were more systematically weathered to an advanced state dominated by kaolinite – creating ideal conditions for Cr adsorption. Erosion of regolith that scavenged mobilized Cr(III) could then facilitate transport of Cr(III)-bearing kaolinite to coastal environments where it contributed to the super-crustal Cr abundances above detrital background preserved in ca. 2.5-2.0 Ga iron formations.},

  abstract = {It has commonly been proposed that the development of complex life is tied to increases in atmospheric oxygenation. However, there is a conspicuous gap in time between the oxygenation of the atmosphere 2.4 billion years ago (Ga) and the first widely-accepted fossil evidence for complex eukaryotic cells {$<$}1.7Ga. At present the gap could either represent poor sampling, poor preservation, and/or difficulties in recognizing early eukaryote fossils, or it could be real and the evolution of complex cells was delayed due to relatively low and/or variable O2 levels in the Paleoproterozoic. To assess the extent and stability of Paleoproterozoic O2 levels, we measured chromium-based oxygen proxies in a {$>$}2400-m core from the Onega Basin (NW-Russia), deposited ∼2.1–2.0 billion years ago—a few hundred million years prior to the oldest definitive fossil evidence for eukaryotes. Fractionated chromium isotopes are documented throughout the section (max. 1.63±0.10‰ δ53Cr), suggesting a long interval (possibly {$>$}100 million years) during which oxygen levels were higher and more stable than in the billion years before or after. This suggests that, if it is the case that complex cells did not evolve until after 1.7 Ga, then this delay was not due to O2-limitation. Instead, it could reflect other limiting factors—ecological or environmental—or could indicate that it simply takes a long time—more than the tens to {$>$}100 million years recorded in Onega Basin sediments—for such biological innovations to evolve.},

  abstract = {The clastic rocks of the late Triassic Xujiahe Formation in the Sichuan Basin of southwestern China are typical unconventional tight sandstone reservoirs with proven natural gas reserves of up to one trillion cubic meters. In particular, the Xu-6 member of the Xujiahe Formation in the Guang'an area of the central Sichuan Basin is a gas reservoir with great exploration and development potential. In this study, we studied the petrography, measured the geophysical properties, and performed mercury injection tests and calculations based on fractal theory on a suite of tight gas sandstone samples from the Xu-6 member to evaluate the pore types and volumes, permeability, and heterogeneity of the reservoirs. The results show that the sandstone reservoirs of the Xu-6 member of the Xujiahe Formation can be divided into the following three types. Type I reservoirs, which are generally of high quality (an average porosity of 12.59\% and an average permeability coefficient of 6.8231 × 10-3 μm2), are dominated by macroscale pores and a uniform distribution of mesoscale and microscale pores; the fractal dimension is 2.45 to 2.59. Type II reservoirs (an average porosity of 8.9\% and an average permeability coefficient of 1.3504 × 10-3 μm2) are dominated by mesoscale pores, followed by microscale pores, whereas the macroscale pores are poorly developed; the fractal dimension range is 2.42–2.69. Type III reservoirs, typically of low quality (an average porosity of 4.67\% and an average permeability coefficient of 0.2947 × 10-3 μm2), are dominated by microscale pores, followed by mesoscale pores with poorly developed or undeveloped macroscale pores; the fractal dimension is 2.46 to 2.81. The varying distribution of pore types leads to significant differences in pore heterogeneity for the three types of reservoirs, suggesting that type III reservoirs are more heterogeneous than type I reservoirs. Our correlation analysis reveals that the physical properties are related to the reservoir heterogeneity, as proxied by the fractal dimension. When the fractal dimension is between 2.45 and 2.6, porosity is variable, but generally high, whereas permeability shows no obvious relationship to the fractal dimension. When the fractal dimension is greater than 2.6, there is a decreasing trend in porosity, and permeability remains at a constant low value as the fractal dimension increases. Based on our quantitative study of physical properties and fractal characteristics of the Xu-6 member sandstone reservoir, microscopic pore characteristics such as fractal dimension hold great theoretical and practical significance as evaluation criteria for unconventional high-quality natural gas reservoirs and can potentially be used for guiding their exploration and development.},

  abstract = {The oxygenation of the atmosphere during the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) at around 2400~Ma triggered an intensification of chemical weathering on Earth’s surface and caused an acidic attack related to the oxidation and dissolution of sulphidic minerals in surface rocks. The oxidation and selective mobilization of specific elements or, vice versa, their retention in weathering crusts during the GOE is well exemplified in the behaviour of redox sensitive elements such as chromium (Cr), uranium (U) and molybdenum (Mo). Intensification in overall silicate weathering rates during the GOE, however, has remained poorly constrained. The Paleoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary succession of the Imandra-Varzuga Greenstone Belt (deposited ca. 2450–2000 million years ago; Ma) on the northern Fennoscandian Shield records the transformation of Earth’s surface conditions from anoxic to oxic. However, the silicate weathering indices of the sediments deposited in the Imandra-Varzuga Basin across the anoxic–oxic transition do not signal a measureable effect of this transition on the weathering regime. Weathering intensity of the Seidorechka Sedimentary Formation and the Umba Sedimentary Formation – deposited prior and after the GOE, respectively – are similarly moderate. A multitude of physical and chemical factors including the sediment protolith, climate, topography and atmospheric pCO2 control overall weathering intensity. Our results suggest that the oxygenation of the atmosphere and the punctuated (sulphuric) acidic weathering did not significantly overwhelm the former controls over the long term. Silicate weathering following the GOE was, either, tempered by removal of weathered materials by the Huronian global glaciations and dropping atmospheric pCO2 levels, or the felsic protolith and higher latitudional position led to locally muted weathering intensities to be recorded in the post-GOE Umba Sedimentary Formation despite increased background weathering rates.},

  abstract = {Microbial mats floating within multiple hydrothermally sourced streams in El Tatio, Chile, frequently exhibit brittle siliceous crusts ( 1 mm thick) above the air–water interface. The partially silicified mats contain a diverse assemblage of microbial clades and metabolisms, including cyanobacteria performing oxygenic photosynthesis. Surficial crusts are composed of several amorphous silica layers containing well-preserved filaments (most likely cyanobacteria) and other cellular textures overlying EPS-rich unsilicified mats. Environmental logs, silica crust distribution, and microbial preservation patterns provide evidence for crust formation via repeated cycles of evaporation and silica precipitation. Within the mats, in situ microelectrode profiling reveals that daytime oxygen concentrations and pH values are diminished beneath silica crusts compared with adjacent unencrusted communities, indicating localized inhibition of oxygenic photosynthesis due to light attenuation. As a result, aqueous conditions under encrusted mats have a higher saturation state with regard to amorphous silica compared with adjacent, more active mats where high pH increases silica solubility, likely forming a modest feedback loop between diminished photosynthesis and crust precipitation. However, no fully lithified sinters are associated with floating encrusted mats in El Tatio streams, as both subaqueous and subaerial silica precipitation are limited by undersaturated, low-SiO2 ({$<$}150 ppm) stream waters. By contrast, well-cemented sinters can form by evaporation in silica-undersaturated solutions above 200 ppm SiO2. Floating mats in El Tatio therefore represent a specific sinter preservation window, where evaporation in silica-undersaturated microbial mats produces crusts, which preserve cells and affect mat chemistry, but low-silica concentrations prevent the formation of lasting sinter deposits. Patterns of silica precipitation in El Tatio microbial communities show that the preservation potential of silicifying mats in the rock record is strongly dependent on aqueous silica concentrations.},

  abstract = {Unlike modern Mn(IV)-dominated manganese nodules, ancient manganese deposits primarily contain Mn(II) (manganous) mineral phases. The general assumption is that these manganous minerals formed post-depositionally from a Mn(IV) precursor phase during diagenesis and metamorphism. However, recent studies have shown that aqueous Mn(II) may combine with either CO32-(aq) or H4SiO4(aq) to nucleate and precipitate as primary manganous phases within anoxic waters. These findings thus make it difficult to assess what comprised the primary mineral assemblage of ancient Mn deposits, which in turn, has implications for understanding the redox fabric of the past marine water column. Here, we investigate the paragenesis and oxidation state of various Mn minerals (oxides, carbonates, and silicates) from the late Devonian Xialei and middle to late Permian Zunyi manganese deposits in South China. Through characterization of the micro-scale distribution, composition, and speciation of different Mn-bearing mineral phases, we provide evidence to support an oxidative mechanism during Mn cycling at the time of deposition. We document the presence of a residual oxide phase (hausmannite; Mn3O4) that represents a primary to early formed Mn(III)-bearing oxide preserved in Mn(II)-carbonate nodules. Additionally, we observe spherulitic textures comprised of mixed-valence Mn(II,III,IV)-silicates enclosed in diagenetic Mn(II)-carbonate laminations. Our results allow for the construction of a paragenetic model for these deposits beginning with the reduction of a primary Mn(IV) phase and the subsequent precipitation of intermediate Mn(III)-oxide or -silicate mineral phases. Following continued exposure to reducing conditions during early diagenesis, Mn(III)-oxides were then replaced by Mn(II)-carbonates. Similarly, Mn(III)-silicates were transformed into various Mn(II)-silicates during late-stage diagenesis and metamorphism. This model suggests that the accumulation of various divalent Mn mineral phases in ancient sediments may, therefore, be indicative of deposition under a water column with a sufficient oxidizing potential to induce Mn(II) oxidation.},

  abstract = {The origin process of manganese ores remains unsolved worldwide. Exploring the origins of stromatolites that contain manganese may be a key to deciphering the sedimentary environments and metallogenic processes of these deposits. However, only a few manganese stromatolites have been discovered and described until now. Microbialites are well developed in the manganese deposits, located near the top of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in Chengkou area of Chongqing, northern Yangtze Craton, but has not been explicitly studied; and whether they are true stromatolites or Epiphyton microbialites remains controversial. Based on field and core observations and thin section microscopy, the characteristics of five types of manganese stromatolites and their growth modes are described in detail in this study. The results show that these stromatolites grew in a biostrome in shoal and lagoon environments and were syngenetic with oncolites and oolites on a carbonate ramp behind the shoal. Manganese stromatolites can be categorized into three forms: (1) stratiform; (2) columnar, which includes branched and columnar types; and (3) stratiform-columnar, which is a transitional type. Based on a criterion that the diameter is less than or greater than 1\,mm, columnar stromatolites are further divided into micro-columnar ({$<$}\,1\,mm) and columnar ({$>$}\,1\,mm) columns, which display synchronous growth and are similar to Pseudogymnosolenaceae. Their shapes are mainly controlled by water depths and hydrodynamic strengths. The greater the water depth, the more columnar the columns tend to be. Excessively strong hydrodynamic conditions decrease the growth rate of stromatolites, and they even stopped growth due to wave damage. Furthermore, pillared laminar textures (not Epiphyton), which consist of dendritic, micro-branched and micro-columnar stromatolites, are a common feature of the larger stratiform, stratiform-columnar and columnar stromatolites. The alternations of laminae with different internal textures record subtle fluctuations in water depths and hydrodynamic strengths, which indicate that stromatolite growth is controlled by tidal cycles at the lamina level. Therefore, it is possible that the vertical evolution of the stromatolites could reveal the changing characteristics of both local and regional sedimentary environments, i.e., stromatolite shape changes from columnar to stratiform can represent the onset of shallower environments with weak hydrodynamic conditions. In addition, as important reef builders in shallow carbonate ramps, microstromatolites accelerate the development from ramp to platform. Indicators of microbial control on stromatolite shapes and manganese sedimentation processes include the fabric of stromatolite laminae, organic rhodochrosite with a micritic texture that is usually clotted, spherical, tubular, fibrous or dendritic, which suggests that the laminae resulted from microbially induced in situ precipitation.},
