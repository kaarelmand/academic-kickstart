  abstract = {Ambers—fossilized plant resins—are a rich and unique source of paleoecological data due to their ability to preserve soft body fossils. However, interpretations concerning their environmental context are often hampered by uncertainties in the relationship between assemblages of inclusions and geological context, particularly in the case of secondarily redeposited ambers such as those from the Paleogene of Central Europe. Here we use stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analyses, as well as FTIR spectroscopy, from the northwestern Ukrainian Rovno amber deposit, to provide independent constraints on the geographic and temporal origins of Rovno amber. These analyses address the relationship between the Rovno and Baltic amber deposits as well as German Bitterfeld amber—a subject of considerable debate regarding their provenance. Rovno amber has a δ13C signature of −23.3 ± 0.9‰, similar to both Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers. Since there is a secular decreasing δ13C trend among amber deposits since the Early Eocene, a roughly contemporaneous origin of these deposits in the Eocene can be deduced. However, Rovno amber displays a δ2H signature of −258 ± 9‰, 19‰ more positive than Baltic amber, and directly comparable to Bitterfeld amber. This difference relates to precipitation sources and mean annual temperatures of the amber source regions, and suggests a much more southerly origin of Rovno amber relative to Baltic amber. FTIR spectra of each of these ambers are nearly identical and suggest that resin-producing trees were from similar families, despite contrasting source regions. Thus, we provide the first clear geochemical evidence for the distinct origin of Rovno and Baltic amber deposits, with implications for paleoecological studies involving inclusions from these deposits, and for determining the provenance of archaeological amber finds.},

  abstract = {Sedimentary phosphorites comprise a major phosphorus (P) ore, yet their formation remains poorly understood. Extant polyphosphate-metabolizing bacterial communities are known to act as bacterial phosphate-pumps, leading to episodically high dissolved phosphate concentrations in pore waters of organic-rich sediment. These conditions can promote the precipitation of amorphous precursor phases that are quickly converted to apatite—usually in carbonate fluorapatite form [Ca10(PO4,CO3)6F2-3]. To assess the mechanisms underpinning the nucleation and growth of sedimentary apatite, we sampled P-rich sediments from the Namibian shelf, a modern environment where phosphogenesis presently occurs. The P-rich fraction of the topmost centimetres of sediment mainly consists of pellets about 50–400 μm in size, which in turn are comprised of micron-sized apatite particles that are often arranged into radial structures with diameters ranging from 2 to 4 μm, and morphologies that range from rod-shapes to dumbbells to spheres that resemble laboratory-grown fluorapatite–gelatin nanocomposites known from double-diffusion experiments in organic matrices. The nucleation and growth of authigenic apatite on the Namibian shelf is likely analogous to these laboratory-produced precipitates, where organic macromolecules play a central role in apatite nucleation and growth. The high density of apatite nucleation sites within the pellets ({$>$}109 particles per cm3) suggests precipitation at high pore water phosphate concentrations that have been reported from the Namibian shelf and may be attributed to microbial phosphate pumping. The intimate association of organic material with the apatite could suggest a possible role of biological substrata, such as exopolymeric substances (EPS), in the nucleation of apatite precursors. Importantly, we do not observe any evidence that the apatite particles are actual phosphatized microbes, contradicting some earlier studies. Nevertheless, these results further evidence the potential importance of microbially derived (extracellular) organic matter as a template for phosphatic mineral nucleation in both recent and ancient phosphorites.},

  abstract = {The exceptionally organic-rich rocks of the 1.98 Ga Zaonega Formation deposited in the Onega Basin, NW Russia, have refined our understanding of Earth System evolution during the Paleoproterozoic rise in atmospheric oxygen. These rocks were formed in vent- or seep-influenced settings contemporaneous with voluminous mafic volcanism and contain strongly 13C-depleted organic matter. Here we report new isotopic (δ34S, Δ33S, Δ36S, δ13Corg) and mineralogical, major element, total sulphur and organic carbon data for the upper part of the Zaonega Formation, which was deposited shortly after the termination of the Lomagundi-Jatuli positive carbon isotope excursion. The data were collected on a recently obtained 102 m drill-core section and show a δ13Corg shift from −38‰ to −25‰. Sedimentary sulphides have δ34S values typically between +15‰ and +25‰ reflecting closed-system sulphur isotope behaviour driven by high rates of microbial sulphate reduction, high sulphate demand, hydrothermal activity and hydrocarbon seepage. Four intervals record δ34S values that exceed +30‰. We interpret these unusually 34S-enriched sulphides to be a result of limited sulphate diffusion into pore waters due to changes in sedimentation and/or periods of basinal restriction. Additionally, there are four negative δ34S excursions that are interpreted to reflect changes in the open/closed-system behaviour of sulphate reduction or availability of reactive iron. Our findings highlight the influence of basinal processes in regulating sulphur isotope records and the need for care before interpreting such signals as reflecting global conditions.},

  abstract = {Chemical weathering of continental crust plays an important role in Earth‘s surface evolution and also controls the nutrient flow to the ocean. Major changes in the development of Earth’s geochemical system were taking place at a critical time coinciding with the Archean-Proterozoic transition when Earth’s atmosphere became oxygenated, thus triggering a whole new set of chemical weathering reactions. A paleoweathering crust on basalts of the Kuksha Volcanic Formation in the Paleoproterozoic Imandra-Varzuga Greenstone Belt, northwestern Russia developed between 2.5 and 2.44 Ga, just before the Great Oxidation Event and can potentially shed light on the paleoatmosphere composition and weathering modes of this time. The 3 m-thick Kuksha paleoweathering profile is characterized by Al-phyllosilicate clay minerals that are typical products of strong chemical weathering of igneous rocks. The mineralogy of the uppermost part of Kuksha weathering crust confirms formation under high CO2 partial pressures, consistent with previous estimates of pCO2 exceeding 0.1 atm during that time interval. That is in agreement with the geochemical and mineralogical proxies thereby also suggesting an intense acidic weathering under low-oxygen conditions.},

  abstract = {Rare Earth Elements and Yttrium (REE+Y) distribution in authigenic phases are frequently used as proxies for reconstructing past seawater conditions. Sedimentary apatite precipitates near the sediment-water interface and is therefore capable of recording the REE+Y composition of the overlying water column. While the overprinting of primary REE+Y signal during late stage diagenesis is a widely known phenomenon, less is known about early diagenetic effects. In this study, we investigate the REE+Y distribution in Recent sedimentary apatites found on the Namibian shelf using in situ mapping by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The Namibian phosphorite deposits consist of reworked and redeposited pelletal apatitic grains, ranging from Miocene to Pleistocene in age, and pristine concretionary apatitic grains that formed during Pleistocene to Recent. The results of this study show that the REE+Y signatures of pelletal and concretionary apatitic grains are different with both types showing intragranular variability and differences between grain centers and rims. The REE+Y are concentrated in the external part of the apatitic grains, forming a 10–20 μm wide “enrichment zone”. While the central parts of apatitic grains are low in REE+Y (∑REE+Y {$<$} 450 mg/kg), the external layers can reach ∑REE+Y concentrations as high as 4100 mg/kg. REE+Y patterns from the center of Recent concretionary apatitic grains are similar to the REE+Y distribution of modern seawater. Enriched rims of Recent concretionary apatitic grains as well as pelletal grains have lost the characteristic modern seawater features: negative Ce-anomaly and high Y/Ho ratio. The REE+Y patterns of these enrichment zones indicate REE+Y scavenging from suboxic-sulfidic pore water after burial or during precipitation at the fluctuating redoxcline. It is evident that REE+Y patterns in bulk digests of authigenic apatite cannot be relied on to record paleoseawater characteristics. Micro-scale REE+Y analyses of apatitic grains can, however, reveal aspects of their diagenetic histories.},
